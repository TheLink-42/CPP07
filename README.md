## Whatever (Exercise 00)

Implement the following function templates.

**Rules to follow:**
* Swap: Swap the values of two given parameters. No return value.
* Min: Compares the two values given as parameters and returns the smallest one. If they are equal, return the second one.
* Max: Compares the two values given as parameters and returns the greatest one. If they are equal, return the second one.
* All functions must be available for every type that supports all comparisson operators.
* Both parameters in each function must be the same type.
* Implement a main function with tests on your templated function to ensure everything works as desired.

## Iter (Exercise 01)

Implement a function template *iter*.

**Rules to follow:**
* Function must take 3 parameters
	* First parameter: Address of an array.
	* Second parameter: Length of the array.
	* Third parameter: Function that will be called on every element of the array.
* Function will not have return value.
* Must work with any type of array.
* Implement a main function with tests on your templated function to ensure everything works as desired.

## Array (Exercise 02)

Develop a calss templat Array which contains elements of type T with the following implementations.

**Rules to follow:**
* Constructor with no parameters: Creates an empty array.
* Constructor with unsigned int *n* as parameter: Creates an array of *n* elemets.
* Constructor by copy and assignmnt operator.
* Must use operator new[] to allocate memory.
* Preventive allocation is forbidden.
* Must never access non-allocated memory.
* Elements must be accessible using operator [].
* A member function size() which return the number of elements int the array.
* Implement a main function with tests on your templated function to ensure everything works as desired.
* Handle possible errors with appropriate error messages or exceptions.
